For a ''value object'' to be represented as text in a cell, it needs one or more of the following:
 * A ''public static Object parse(String)'' method in the class; and/or
 * A ''public constructor that takes a String as argument; and/or
 * A ''delegate parser'' that will handle parsing a String into an object of the ''value object'' class; and/or
  * A ''delegate parser'' is needed if the value object belong to a class that you can't change. Eg, if you're using a provided ''Date'' or ''Point'', etc; and/or
 * For checking only, the result of ''toString()'' can be used
!3 ''Value Object'' has it's own parse() method
When a ''value object'' class has a ''parse()'' method, that's used to convert between text in a cell and an object of that class:

>SelfParseString
>HasParseMethod
^UseStaticParseMethod

!3 ''Value Object'' has a constructor that takes a String

^HasConstructorWithString
^HasConstructorWithStringThatThrows

!3 ''Value Object'' has an associated !-PropertyEditor-!
^HasPropertyEditor

!3 ''Value Object'' is parsed by a ${parseDelegate}
You may be using a library class, such as a ''Date'', as a ''value object''. But you're unable to change it. So you can use a ${parseDelegate} instead. The ${parseDelegate} needs to be registered to handle parsing of a specific ''value object'' class.
 * We'll pretend that class ''!-MyFixedPoint-!'' is to be a ''value object'', but that we can't alter it to add a ''parse()'' method.
 * So we introduce a ${parseDelegate}, ''!-MyFixedPointDelegate-!''. In Java the delegate class ''!-MyFixedPointDelegate-!'' has a method:
  * ''public !-MyFixedPoint-! parse(String)'' that parses a String into a ''!-MyFixedPoint-!'' object
  * This method is used twice in the first table, to parse (and create) both the value for the argument and the ''expected'' value.
  * It's used once in the second table, to create the argument.
 * In Java, the ''!-MyFixedPoint-!'' class still needs an ''equals()'' method to compare the ''expected'' and ''actual'' values.
  * This is used in the first two tables
 * In Java, the ''!-MyFixedPoint-!'' class also needs a ''toString()'' method to show itself when there is an error
  * This is shown in the second table, where the ''expected'' and the ''actual'' value of the point differ, and so the ''actual value'' needs to be displayed
 * If the type of the result of a method call is a value object, it will not be auto-wrapped with a ''!-DomainObjectCheckTraverse-!''.
  * That's so that it can be '''check'''ed in workflow, which is usually what's required
  * So we need to explicitly wrap it in the code if we want to check its properties.
 * Similar methods will be required with other programming languages. See the appropriate documentation.

^SpecifySuperParseDelegate

Optional functionality can be provided in a ${parseDelegate} so that it:
 * Can also be responsible for the ''equals()'' check. Then, specialised checking can be provided (such as over a subset of the properties).
 * Can also be responsible for the ''show'' (ie, ''toString()''). Then the display format of the ''value object'' can be controlled. Eg, to display the ''Date'' in the appropropriate format.

!3 ''Value Object'' doesn't have a ''parse()'' method nor a parse delegate, but is only checked
If it's only checked, ${fitLibrary} makes use of the ''toString()'' method and matches by comparing strings:

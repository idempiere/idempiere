!2 A table for a core fixture, such as ''!-ColumnFixture-!'', can have one or more arguments following the fixture class name in the first row of the table.
These can be used to pass extra information to the fixture, such as values that apply to all of the rows.

These arguments can be accessed as Strings by the fixture subclass written by the programmer.

In this example, two arguments are provided in this way:

|!-fit.specify.ColumnFixtureUnderTestWithArgs-!|1|2|
|''third''|''sum()''|
|0|3|
|10|13|

The way the arguments are collected is implementation-dependent. In the Java version, they are accessed in a fixture by calling the inherited method ''getArgs()'', which return a ''String[]''.

${fitLibrary} provides a limited means of recording storytests: those in which dynamic variables are used.

A single unbound dynamic variable that is used as the expected value in '''is''', '''becomes''' or '''check''' can be recorded. This depends on a recording having been started, in which the property file name is specified.

If a property file defines a subset of the values, any unbound ones will be added.

|^NewPropertyFile|''Any such unbound dynamic variables are written to a new file.''|
|^ExistingPropertyFile|''Any such unbound dynamic variables are written to an existing file.''|
|^NotJustDynamicVariable|''Recording only works with a single dynamic variable, with no extra text.''|
|^FileProblem|''There is a problem in writing the property file at the end of a storytest.''|

It would be possible to generalise the binding process so that it included expected values such as the following:
 * AB@{cd}CD
 * @{a}/@{b}
 * @{a}+@{a}
As well as bindings for '''matches'''.

Let Rick know if you have a need for this generality.

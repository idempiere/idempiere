!3 Tables can be used to test (some of) the properties of a domain object.
^SimpleProperties are listed as name-value pairs, similar to how a UI may be laid out with label-entry pairs.
^ListProperties may be included. Lists are shown downwards, as usual.
^ObjectProperties. A property may be another domain object. That can be shown as an embedded table.
^PrivatePropertyMethods

^ChecksFail - when expectations aren't met, the differences are shown in the report

^UnknownProperty
^IncorrectValueType
^IncompletePair

''Defined actions'' may also be defined within classes, to provide an object-oriented approach to storytests. The class system is similar to Java but much simpler; there isn't a notion of static methods, for example.

We need to describe the following:
 * How ''defined actions'' as associated with a class. This is either:
  * Through a local definition of a ''defined action'', which also specifies a class
  * Through a convention of organising ''defined actions'' for a class within a page hierarchy headed by a page with the name ''!-ClassColour-!'', where ''Colour'' is the name of the class of those ''defined actions''.
 * How instances (''wiki objects") are defined
 * How the class of an instance is defined
 * How superclasses are defined
 * How dispatching occurs for calling OO ''defined actions'', using a '''oo''' special action (to be renamed!)
 * How the instance and instance properties are accessed within a ''defined action''
 * How we can implicitly use the '''oo''' special action
 * How we can use a class itself as an instance when there is only one instance of a class needed at once in a storytest
''Dynamic variables'' are used to define instances, instance properties, and class and superclass relationships.

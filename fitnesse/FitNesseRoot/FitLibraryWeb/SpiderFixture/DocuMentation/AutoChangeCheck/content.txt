!2 Changing such checking
#
The checking can be turned off with the action:

|''set checking''|false|

And turned on again with the action:

|''set checking''|true|

There is a timeout period for checking, because they may be a delay due to !-JavaScript-!. The actions repeatedly check until either the value changes as expected or the timeout period is reached. If it times out, an error is given.

The timeout period for checking can be altered, as follows (in milliseconds):

|''checking timeout''|100|

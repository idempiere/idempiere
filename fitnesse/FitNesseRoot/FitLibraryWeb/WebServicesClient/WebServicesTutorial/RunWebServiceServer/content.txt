This runs a server (both file server and web services server) on local port 8093 when you run it as a '''Test'''.

!|fitlibrary.server.WebServerForTestingFixture|

|''start file server on port''|8093|''at directory''|!-FitNesseRoot-!|

|''stop testing server after''|60|''seconds''|

Once it stops running, you can run it again.

 * If you run it too soon, it will give an error because the port is already busy.

 * That can happen if you press the back button soon after hitting '''Test''' and press '''Test''' again; the test is still running in the background.

!3 Warning
#
This file server has limited capability, and is only intended for testing purposes.

It is not guaranteed to be secure.

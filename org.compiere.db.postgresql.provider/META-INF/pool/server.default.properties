# You can add HikariCP settings that are not present in this file. In order to
# use the default just remove or comment out the key all together.

# This property controls the maximum number of milliseconds that a client (that's you) 
# will wait for a connection from the pool. If this time is exceeded without a 
# connection becoming available, a SQLException will be thrown. Lowest acceptable 
# connection timeout is 250 ms. 
# Default: 30000 (30 seconds)
connectionTimeout=60000

# This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed 
# to sit idle in the pool. This setting only applies when minimumIdle is defined 
# to be less than maximumPoolSize. Idle connections will not be retired once the 
# pool reaches minimumIdle connections. Whether a connection is retired as idle 
# or not is subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds, and average variation 
# of +15 seconds. A connection will never be retired as idle before this timeout. 
# A value of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the pool. 
# The minimum allowed value is 10000ms (10 seconds). 
# Default: 600000 (10 minutes)
#idleTimeout=

# This property controls how frequently HikariCP will attempt to keep a connection 
# alive, in order to prevent it from being timed out by the database or network infrastructure. 
# This value must be less than the maxLifetime value. A "keepalive" will only occur on an idle 
# connection. When the time arrives for a "keepalive" against a given connection, that 
# connection will be removed from the pool, "pinged", and then returned to the pool. The 
# 'ping' is one of either: invocation of the JDBC4 isValid() method, or execution of the 
# connectionTestQuery. Typically, the duration out-of-the-pool should be measured in single 
# digit milliseconds or even sub-millisecond, and therefore should have little or no noticible 
# performance impact. The minimum allowed value is 30000ms (30 seconds), but a value in the 
# range of minutes is most desirable. Default: 0 (disabled)
#keepaliveTime=

# This property controls the minimum number of idle connections that HikariCP 
# tries to maintain in the pool. If the idle connections dip below this value 
# and total connections in the pool are less than maximumPoolSize, HikariCP 
# will make a best effort to add additional connections quickly and efficiently. 
# However, for maximum performance and responsiveness to spike demands, we 
# recommend not setting this value and instead allowing HikariCP to act as a 
# fixed size connection pool. 
# Default: same as maximumPoolSize
#minimumIdle=

# This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, 
# including both idle and in-use connections. Basically this value will determine 
# the maximum number of actual connections to the database backend. A reasonable 
# value for this is best determined by your execution environment. When the pool 
# reaches this size, and no idle connections are available, calls to getConnection() 
# will block for up to connectionTimeout milliseconds before timing out. Please 
# read about pool sizing: https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing
# Default: 10
maximumPoolSize=90

# This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. An 
# in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is closed will it then be 
# removed. On a connection-by-connection basis, minor negative attenuation is applied 
# to avoid mass-extinction in the pool. We strongly recommend setting this value, and 
# it should be several seconds shorter than any database or infrastructure imposed 
# connection time limit. A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), 
# subject of course to the idleTimeout setting. The minimum allowed value is 30000ms
# (30 seconds). 
# Default: 1800000 (30 minutes)
#maxLifetime=

# This property controls the amount of time that a connection can be out of the 
# pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak. A value of 0 
# means leak detection is disabled. Lowest acceptable value for enabling leak detection 
# is 2000 (2 seconds). Default: 0
leakDetectionThreshold=300000
